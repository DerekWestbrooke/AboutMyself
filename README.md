###

<p align="left">My name is Zhenya. I want to be an IT specialist. I am interested in several specialties, such as:</p>
<p> 1️⃣ software development. At the moment I have experience in programming in such programming languages as C, C++, C#, Python and LabView  (this is a graphical programming language), working with SQLite and PostgreSQL databases. I like to program and often I use programming for some tasks.</p> 
<p> 2️⃣ cybersecurity. As for me, this is the most interesting field in IT, because you should have different skills in fields such as cryptography, operating system administration, network building. I`m fond of cryptography. If be honest, it was one of my favorite technical subjects in the university.</p> 
<p> 3️⃣ DataScience. I like this speciality, because it`s include programming and math. I have mentioned that i like programming, so my favorite language is Python. Also I have experience with Pandas and NumPy, which are connected with DataScience. Also I`m keen on math. I always had the best marks. I think that math is the queen of sciences.</p>
